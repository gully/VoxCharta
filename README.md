VoxCharta
=========

Web-scrape the [VoxCharta](http://voxcharta.org) usage statistics.

The usage statistics are available under the `Tools` tab:

+ Institution Statistics
+ Author Statistics
+ My Voting Record
+ User Statistics

Here are the questions I want to ask:

1. What is the distribution of votes per person? (Cumulative distribution plot ordered from high to low)
2. How does the UTexas voting record compare to peer institutions? (Histogram of total votes)
3. How has my voting record changed in time? (Time series density plot binned by month or weeks)
4. Which institution has the highest fraction of negative votes?


Quoting from the website:

> Vox Charta is a clone of arXiv used primarily for astronomy and astrophysics paper discussions. Users of this website have the ability to vote for papers they would like to talk about at the next discussion session. All papers that received votes since the previous discussion appear in an “agenda” at the top of the main page, sorted by the number of votes each paper receives. A copy of this agenda is e-mailed out to the department shortly before the discussion itself.


I would like to thank the creator of VoxCharta, [James Guillochon](http://astrocrash.net/).
